				<p>
	If you&rsquo;re ready to book a place on Buy2Rental, you can send a request to the host to book a reservation. If you&rsquo;re unsure about the listing or its availability, you can also send a message to the host.</p>
				<img class="bordered align-center" src="lib/7.jpg">

				<p>
	To send a reservation request:</p>

<p>
	On a listing, click Request to Book.</p>
<p>
	If you see Instant Book, the host is allowing you to book their place instantly. Your reservation will be automatically confirmed.</p>
<p>
	Review your reservation details to make sure everything is correct.</p>
				
				<img class="bordered align-center" src="lib/8.jpg">
				<p>
	Add your payment information.</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	If your request is accepted, you&rsquo;ll be charged in full for the reservation. If the host declines the request or doesn&rsquo;t respond within 24 hours, no charge is made and you can try booking those dates with someone else.</p>

			<section id="what_is_instant_book">
			<h4 class="sv_title">What is Instant Book?</h4>
			
				<p>Instant Book listings don't require approval from the host before you can book them. Instead, you can just choose your travel dates and discuss check-in plans with the host. There is no additional fee for confirming a reservation with Instant Book. </p>
				
				<img class="bordered align-center" src="lib/9.jpg">

			
			<hr>
			</section>
			
			<section id="what_is_a_pre_approval">
			<h4 class="sv_title">What is a pre-approval?</h4>
			
				<p>A pre-approval is a way for host to let guests know that their listing is available when asked about a potential reservation. Once pre-approved, the guest can automatically confirm a booking for the specific dates provided.</p>
				<h5>Hosts</h5>
				<p>When you pre-approve a guest’s inquiry, you give them permission to automatically confirm a booking for specific dates. The dates won’t be blocked on your calendar, so you can pre-approve multiple guests at one time.</p>
				<img class="bordered align-center" src="lib/10.jpg">
							
				<p>Guests have 24 hours to confirm a booking that has been pre-approved. After 24 hours, the guest can still request to book your listing with the price offered during the pre-approval, unless you remove the pre-approval. You can remove the pre-approval at any time in the message thread. </p>
				<h5>Guests</h5>
				<p>
				If a host has sent you a pre-approval, your booking isn’t confirmed until you’ve clicked Book It in the message thread with the host and added your payment information. Hosts can send pre-approvals to many potential guests, so if you’ve found the perfect space, make sure to complete the booking process as soon as possible.</p>
				<img class="bordered align-center" src="lib/11.png">
			 <p>You have 24 hours to accept a pre-approval before it expires. If 24 hours have passed, you can still accept the pre-approval but your host will have to approve your request before your reservation is confirmed.</p>

			<section id="how_do_i_book_a_place_on_vrent">
			<h4 class="sv_title">How do I book a place on Buy2Rental? </h4>			
				<p>When you book a place on Makent, you’re making arrangements to stay in someone’s home. Each host has their own style of hospitality, starting with how they like to get to know their guests. Some hosts want to approve reservations, while others are comfortable letting you book their place instantly without waiting for approval.</p>
				<h5>1. Complete Your Profile</h5>
				<p>In either case, it’s important to know that Makent is a community that relies on trust. Complete your profile before you request a reservation with a host, so they can know a little bit about you when they confirm. Your profile should include photos and verifications, especially because some hosts require guests to have a profile photo or Verified ID in order to book.</p>
				<h5>2. Find the Right Place</h5>
				<p>When searching for a place, make sure to include your dates and number of guests to get the most accurate pricing. Read reviews, descriptions, house rules, and amenities for each place to see if it’s the right fit for your trip. You can always contact the host if you have any questions about their home.</p>
				
				<h5>3. Book It!</h5>
				<p>You’ve found the perfect place, and now it’s time to make it official. This is where the host’s preferred way of booking will determine how you’ll confirm your reservation.</p>
				<h5>Instant Book</h5>
				<p>For hosts who don’t want to approve each reservation, you’ll see a button on their listing that says Instant Book. Like the name suggests, you can confirm a reservation at these places right away. Learn more about Instant Book.</p>
				<h5>Request to Book</h5>
				<p>Many hosts prefer to approve reservations before they’re final. In this case, you’ll see a button on their listing that says Request to Book. To submit a reservation request, you’ll need to enter your payment details. Hosts have 24 hours to accept your request, and your reservation is automatically confirmed once they do. Learn more about submitting a reservation request.</p>
				<p>Once host accept your request you have to pay within 24 hours or else your reservation is automatically expired</p>
